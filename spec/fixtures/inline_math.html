<p>This is some inline math: <span class="inline_math">\(\int _\Omega d\omega = \int _{\partial \Omega } \omega \)</span> (the general form of Stokes’s Theorem). Here’s some more: <span class="inline_math">\( \varphi ^2 = \varphi + 1 \)</span>.</p>
<p>Our main strategy for producing HTML is to pass it through as-is and let MathJax handle the rendering.
