<p>This is some inline math: <span class="inline_math">\( \int_\Omega d\omega = \int_{\partial\Omega} \omega \)</span> (the general form of Stokes’s Theorem).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here’s some more: <span class="inline_math">\( \varphi^2 = \varphi + 1 \)</span>.</p>
<p>Our main strategy for producing HTML is to pass it through as-is and let MathJax handle the rendering.
